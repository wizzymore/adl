# 00001 - Support an assets folder

## Abstract

Adding an assets folder to the `adr` directory would help organize assets, but we don't 
want those to be included in the auto-incrementation of the ADRs or be included in the README.

## Context and Problem Statement

A lot of ADRs have assets associated with them and users need a place to store those assets, ideally alongside the ADRs.

## Considered Options

- Store the assets in the same `adr` directory.
- Store the assets in a subdirectory
- Store the assets in a dot-subdirectory.

## Decision Outcome

Store the assets in a subdirectory
